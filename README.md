# [First Fifty](https://first-fifty.vercel.app/)

This is a writing tool to aid in an exercise from [George Saunder's](https://georgesaundersbooks.com/) [A Swim in a Pond in the Rain](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609280/a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain-by-george-saunders/).

It's a delightful premise that is equal parts simple and challenging: write 200 words using only the first 50 words you write. You can configure 200 and 50, but the idea is to introduce an arbitrary constraint that lures your unique preferences into the fore as you try to write 150 more words with pure recycling.

Built with [Solid]([Solid Website](https://solidjs.com)) and [Hope UI](https://hope-ui.com/).
